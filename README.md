# custom-video-player

This is quite some project to build my knowledge on how to:

~ make an attractive UI

~ make a good-looking modal with blurry background

~ make cool and smooth animation effects

~ manipulate the DOM to improve interactivity, especially with the `video element`.

and so many more

`Resources used:`

~ Heropatterns from `https://heropatterns.com/`

~ fonts from Google Fonts

~ Numerous Icons from `https://fontawesome.com/`

~ w3Schools

~ video tracks from great artists/content creators and movies

~ Inspiration/Knowledge from Jacinto Designs
